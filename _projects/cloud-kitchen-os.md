This project started as a small feature request for an existing Notion page and turned into a complete rebuild of the entire workspace.  I was able to show the business owner what was possible within Notion, and together we were able to build out a full-featured CRM and operations management system and eliminated the need to go out and buy separate SaaS products to fulfill those needs. 

The system had several core features:
- single source of truth for client communications
- meal planning, all the way from ingredient sourcing to cooking time
- recipe management, factoring in each client's dietary needs
- delivery scheduling and route planning
- subscription and payment tracking

This was a custom [Notion](https://notion.so){:target="_blank"} build, so unfortunately it is not publicly accessible.  If you have questions about what we built, [email me!](mailto:t@taylorlearns.com)
