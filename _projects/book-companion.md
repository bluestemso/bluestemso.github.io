This Notion template is intended for self-published or independently-published authors and enables them to create an interactive space for their readers to engage with the concepts and content of their books in a structured way.  

In addition to providing the reader with a place to keep their notes and reflections, the author has the ability to fill the template with:
- key concepts to highlight their importance,
- visual aids that might otherwise be difficult to publish,
- targeted questions for the reader to answer directly in the template,
- exercises to practice skills taught in the book, and
- clickable links to other resources that might be helpful.

This template is available as a free template in [Notion](https://notion.so){:target="_blank"} at [this link](https://bluestem.notion.site/Book-Title-Companion-8d8aa5b6887b4ba29836471c3aa104af?pvs=4){:target="_blank"}.
