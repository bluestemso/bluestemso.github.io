"ojo" is a simple app to help remind anyone who works at a screen for hours at a time to give their eyes a break.  Experts recommend taking a 20 second break every 20 minutes to look at an object 20 feet away, and ojo reminds you to do just that.

The primary goal of this project was for me to develop and deploy my first app to the Google Play Store.  Along the way, I learned all about the complexity of managing even simple user flows with state management, adaptive themes, and implementing localization.  

The app was built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/){:target="_blank"} and is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=solutions.bluestem.ojo202020){:target="_blank"}.
