I'm not even a year into this journey, and I've already lost track of how many different blog/portfolio/landing pages I've built for myself and bluestem (my consulting/services business).  Let's see if I can retrace my steps:
<!--more-->
1. I started on Wix, a fully managed platform, because it was the tool that seemed the most approachable at the time. 
2. After getting comfortable with Python and Django, I built a blog with Django and deployed it on Railway after watching a tutorial from [Coding For Entrepreneurs](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/).
3. Partially because I realized my Railway credits would be expiring, and partially because I wanted to get some practice on a different platform, I moved the site over to Fly.io.  Learned a lot about how opinionated those PaaS providers can be.
4. Got a big head about me and thought I could replicate [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/).  I mean, he even offers up the [source](https://simonwillison.net/about/#about-site). Pretty quickly realized that I was in over my head and jumped back to my previous site.
5. After changing my focus from Python/Django over to Flutter, took a stab at building a blog/portfolio web app.  The wrestling was good exercise, but after realizing just how easily my Flutter projects could be embedded in vanilla HTML + JavaScript page, went the complete opposite direction and started looking for the simplest solution out there.
6. Found GitHub Pages with Jekyll right under my nose.  Simple, free, and a great way to practice my markdown (those Gmail formatting shortcuts are buried *deep* in my fingers).
I've always been a big fan of builders with blogs/portfolios that are built with the technology they build with (like just about every Three.js developer), but I think I've got a ways to go in creating my style and getting good at my craft before that happens.  So for now it's vanilla Jekyll on GitHub Pages for me.
