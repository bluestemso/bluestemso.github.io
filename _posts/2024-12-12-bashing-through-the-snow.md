Just finished three of the bash tutorials on freeCodeCamp and feels like I'm driving on a freshly plowed road. Not sure how universal this is, but I've been blindly copying so many bash commands along this journey so far, and it bothered me so much that I didn't understand why so many of them worked, or how they worked. I realize that it might be putting the cart in front of the horse a little bit, but I would definitely recommend learning bash earlier than later. Between having the context while you're developing and also being able to significantly improve your development efficiency, it's such a great tool to have on your belt.
