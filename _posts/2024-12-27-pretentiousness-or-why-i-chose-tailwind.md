I'm nowhere near qualified yet to comment on the actual merits of Tailwind as it relates to most of the other common CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Bulma, etc), but I do know why I chose to implement it on this blog. 
<!--more-->
I don't even remember where I heard or read this, but an experienced dev said that he could immediately identify a site that used one of the more opinionated frameworks, whereas Tailwind wasn't nearly as easy to spot. I then decided that using anything other than Tailwind would be the equivalent of showing up to prom in what I thought was the coolest, most unique tux, only to discover that two of my least favorite people were wearing the same thing. Now it's been a week since I implemented it (with considerable help from Cursor), and a one hour struggle with a simple alignment issue has shown me just how much I'm in over my head in the CSS waters. 
However, and perhaps misguidedly, I've decided that I'm not giving up and I'm riding the horse I came in on. [Dave Gray's Tailwind CSS Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/lCxcTsOHrjo?si=pO8Jm4oOKTvjYFUR) has been great so far, although even it is moving pretty quickly for me. And I've already gone through most of the CSS stuff on freeCodeCamp. Yet another example of how AI code assistants can quickly get you over your skis as a novice. 
Another a reminder to start with basics (even if it makes me look... basic) and then upgrade later as I get more proficient.
