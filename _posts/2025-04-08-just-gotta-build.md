I know full well the right way to improve as a dev is to build every day. 

The real obstacle for me is deciding what to build.  Ideally, I would be working on a unique idea that at least has the potential to become a valuable product.  But boy oh boy am I great at talking myself out of just about every single idea.  So absent that, I *should* at least be building replicas (another to-do list app, recipe manager, etc.) just to get in the reps, but then I convince myself that is a waste of time because none of them would ever be able to stand out in the crowd.

Gotta get out of this loop.  Just gotta build.
