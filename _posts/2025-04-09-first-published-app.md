I released my first production app to the Google Play store today!  
<!--more-->

The app is a timer/reminder for resting your eyes when working at a screen for hours on end.  It's intentionally simple as the purpose of making it was just to go through the process of testing, packaging, and releasing an app to the store.  I didn't want to include any kind of payment processing or user data so as to minimize security risk.

But now that's done, time to move on to the next one.
