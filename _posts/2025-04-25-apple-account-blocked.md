I set up a dedicated Apple Account a little over a week ago so that I could isolate all of my developer stuff from my personal Apple Account.  I jumped right in to the Apple Developer Program enrollment process, submitted my application, paid my fee, and got the acceptance email. However, started running into a bunch of weird error messages when trying to deploy my app.  Figured I had done something wrong, so wiped as much as I could and started over.  Then kept getting blocked when trying to log in to my Apple Account.  "Apple Account has been locked and can't be used."  Shouldn't be a big deal to fix, I thought.  Boy, was I wrong.

Apple seemingly decided that my account should be locked within 24 hours of me paying my $100 enrollment fee.  No reason provided, and my two submitted requests to support have simply been denied.  Once again, no reason given.  I figured I'd wandered into some weird corner of Apple's system, so Googled it.  Turns out there are *a lot* of us.  Not sure how many, but swirling chatter of class action suits, months with no response, and the most common response from Apple: "Create a new account".

I had heard all the warnings about locking my livelihood into a platform like Apple or Google, as is necessary when you're developing for mobile, but I hadn't run into anything or anyone that had a truly devastating experience, so wrote it off as a slightly irrational fear.  But after reading all these posts from people who one day just completely lost access to their decade-old personal and/or professional Apple Accounts for no reason at all, and Apple has given them absolutely no response, justification, or apology, is really sad to see.

I found an email address posted on Reddit (as Apple's site was useless in providing a means to get support because you can't request support unless you have a unlocked account...) and sent something off.  Here's to hoping.
